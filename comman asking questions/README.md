[7/30, 19:30]  https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/minimum-swaps/1



**this is the question to find the min swap to sort the array**
Now another variation of this , min swap to sort the array in decreasing order
*Now we want in decreasing order, so sort them in decreasing order and find swap count(other logic remain same ) only instead of sorting in increasing order now you need to sort in decreasing order , think it logically , you get the feeling, like this you can get a lof of variation ****

/ ****************if they ask min swap to sort array in DECREASING order*********************
	   //  sort(arr.rbegin(), arr.rend()); // Sorting in decreasing order
