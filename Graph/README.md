[5/26/2022, 18:00]  https://leetcode.com/problems/flood-fill/    very very important concept that is coloring approach or say rotten egges life or say spreading infection problem , a lot of variation based on matrix problem of                       luv vi of graph

[5/26/2022, 19:10]  https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/         this is another version of problem mixture of two concept -- connected comp and matrix graph coloring approach

[5/27/2022, 08:57]  https://leetcode.com/problems/rotting-oranges/  this is the supperr problem of graph , a lot of varn of this ***

[5/27/2022, 14:31]  that is rotten orange

[5/27/2022, 15:03]  https://www.spoj.com/problems/NAKANJ/       minimus knight move -----> this problem is based on "SHORTEST PATH AND BASED ON ROTTEN ORANGE AND BFS"  A SUPPPPPEERRR Problem  of luv vi (shortest path using bfs)         we used bfs instead of dfs because we can go one step at a time of  all possible adjacent side(like rotten orange) , in dfs it is like island problem menas chalte jao jab tak you get land  **********************

[5/27/2022, 15:16]  shortest path means --==> minimum number of moves a knight takes to reach from start to destination

[5/27/2022, 15:55]  remember                               rotten orange problem is nothing but its simple " multisource bfs "  what happen that there is matrix so we store pair of cordinate of all the source at a time  and in graph a simple node so we store  a simple int that is the only difference  ,,,,,,, so let see the difference

[5/27/2022, 15:57]  https://www.codechef.com/problems/SNSOCIAL     --------------> THIS IS THE SUPER PROBLEM BASED ON ROTTED ORANGE  NINETY PERCENT CHANCES THAT THIS TYPE OF PROBLEM WILL ASKED IN INTERVIEW -----------BASED ON MULTISOURCE AND ROTTEN ORANGE(FULL CONCEPT)****************************

[5/28/2022, 11:25]  https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/min-cost-path/   much important problem (max chance to ask such type )******************

[5/29/2022, 13:08]  https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/snake-ladder-problem/     best problem of like rotten orange problem)  purify your graph concept

[5/29/2022, 14:28]  https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/valid-path/         same concept as other like(matrix moving ) but this question many company asked

[6/4/2022, 15:32]  https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/largest-distance-between-nodes-of-a-tree/       *this is the most important problem  because here we have to find the distance "largest between two node" or we can say that "diameter between the node" and we know that diameter is largest distance between two node  and            most important thing is that here you have given the array  instead of tree ,             concepty -----> by using two times dfs or bfs run  ------->first time find the farthest node from root and than  find the  max distance from that node by running second time dfs or bfs*

[6/12/2022, 19:52]  **when ever they talking about the shortest distance or talking about the min/max distance than come to mind is dijkstra means(to use the (pair of set or pq)**

[6/13/2022, 20:26]  *when you got the problem on the matrix , to find the distance or they say about any target than (solve by bfs using distance technique(it checking all adjacent side , pls remember the variation)*

[6/13/2022, 20:56]  *here mx element act as a rotten orange*

[6/14/2022, 19:13]  *TIPS-----> WHENEVER THEY TALK ABOUT TO MIN COST TO CONNECT ALL POINT/CITIES/NODE ETC. MEANS IT IS THE PROBLEM OF (MST) MIND IT**

[6/15/2022, 12:11]  https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/bipartite-graph/1/#   **chances  a lot of variation*
